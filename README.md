# DevOps Apprenticeship: Project Exercise

## System Requirements

The project uses poetry for Python to create an isolated environment and manage package dependencies. To prepare your system, ensure you have an official distribution of Python version 3.11 and install Poetry using one of the following commands (as instructed by the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#system-requirements)):

### Poetry installation (Bash)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py | python -
```

### Poetry installation (PowerShell)

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

## Dependencies

The project uses a virtual environment to isolate package dependencies. To create the virtual environment and install required packages, run the following from your preferred shell:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

You'll also need to clone a new `.env` file from the `.env.template` to store local configuration options. This is a one-time operation on first setup:

```bash
$ cp .env.template .env  # (first time only)
```

The `.env` file is used by flask to set environment variables when running `flask run`. This enables things like development mode (which also enables features like hot reloading when you make a file change). There's also a [SECRET_KEY](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/config/#SECRET_KEY) variable which is used to encrypt the flask session cookie.

## Adding keys to .env

The Todo List is synchronized with [Trello's API](https://trello.com), which means that in order to get the app running, you need to add keys to `.env`. You need to create an account int Trello, and add a new board.

`TRELLO_CONSUMER_KEY` can be found at the top of [this page](https://trello.com/app-key), and `TRELLO_ACCESS_TOKEN` can be generated by clicking on the _Token_ link on the same page.

To get the `TRELLO_BOARD_ID`, you can Inspect Element, and check the Network tab while editing the board name. It should be an id of 24 characters.

## Running the App

Once the all dependencies have been installed, start the Flask app in development mode within the Poetry environment by running:
```bash
$ poetry run flask run
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with fsevents reloader
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 226-556-590
```
Now visit [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) in your web browser to view the app.

## Running the App through Docker

Build and run the app by running `BUILD_TARGET={build_target} docker-compose up`, where {build_target} can be `development` or `production`.
`development` starts a Flask app, whereas `production` uses gunicorn/wsgi.

When making changes to the codebase, build the docker image using the development build target. Changes should be picked up automatically, but if you need to restart, you can just use `docker-compose up` and `docker-compose down`.

## Running the tests

Tests can be found under todo_app/tests. In order to run them, run 'pytest' in a terminal, from the root directory


## Deploying on an Azure App Service
* Build the production docker image by running `docker build --target production --tag <dockerhub-username>/todo-app .`
* Login to Docker Hub (`docker login`) and push the image (`docker push <dockerhub-username>/todo-app:latest`) 
* Create the App Service in Azure if it doesn't already exist. Make sure you set the "Publish" field to "Docker Container" and the "Image Source" is set to DockerHub.
* When the app is created, go to the Configure tab and add the environment variables. Also add an env variable to set `WEBSITES_PORT=5000`
* Enjoy!

Note: If you need to re-deploy a docker image, you need to do steps 1 and 2, and additionally:
* Run `curl -dH -X POST "<webhook>"`. You can get the webhook from the App Service's _Deployment Center_ tab. Make sure to escape `$`!
